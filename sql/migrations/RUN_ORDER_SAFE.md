# Connection System - Safe Migration Files

## ✅ Cleanup Complete - Only Essential Files Remain

### Quick Start - Just Run This:
```sql
000_ALL_CONNECTION_SYSTEM_SAFE.sql
```
This single file contains everything you need in the correct order.

---

## Alternative: Run Files Individually

### Core Migrations (in order):
```sql
1. 000_connection_system_prerequisites.sql    # Setup functions & UUID
2. 040_create_connections_table_safe.sql      # Connections table
3. 041_create_connection_invitations_table_safe.sql # Invitations
4. 042_create_user_privacy_settings_table_safe.sql  # Privacy settings
5. 043_create_group_invitations_table_safe.sql      # Group invitations
```

### Verification:
```sql
test_connection_system.sql    # Run this to verify everything worked
```

## Utility Files (if needed):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `check_uuid_status.sql` | Diagnose UUID extension issues |
| `install_uuid_extension.sql` | Manual UUID extension installation |
| `rollback_040_043_connection_system.sql` | Rollback all changes |

---

## What Was Deleted:
- ❌ All non-safe original versions (had syntax errors)
- ❌ Debug files (debug_040.sql, etc.)
- ❌ Test files (040_test_syntax.sql)
- ❌ Alternative versions (_clean, _v2, _minimal)
- ❌ Outdated documentation

## What Remains:
- ✅ Safe versions only (with IF NOT EXISTS)
- ✅ Prerequisites and utilities
- ✅ All-in-one combined file
- ✅ Rollback and test scripts
- ✅ Essential documentation

---

## Key Features of Safe Migrations:
- **Idempotent**: Can run multiple times without errors
- **Smart**: Detects existing objects and skips them
- **Safe**: Won't fail if tables/indexes already exist
- **Complete**: Handles constraints, triggers, and functions

## For SQL Client Users:
All files are compatible with SQL clients (no psql-specific commands).
Just paste and run!
